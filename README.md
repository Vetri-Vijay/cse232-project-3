# Project 3 CSE 232 Fall Semester 2021

This project used classes in C++ to implement a car racing simulator, which is played using function calls to the Vehicle object. It utilizes classes and objects to represent vehicles and race tracks, and demonstrates encapsulation, the use of setters and getters, friend functions, and pointer objects. This can be considered an introduction to Design Patterns (CSE 335).

Instructions to run the code will be added. You can run the already compiled file using ./a.out.
